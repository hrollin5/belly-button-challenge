# Belly Button Challenge
This project highlights the following technical skills:
* Reading data into a JavaScript file from an API
* Visualizing the data using Plotly
* Creating a custom, interactive dashboard

## Objective
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Data
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset is a catalog of the bacteria present in 153 belly buttons.  
The dataset was accessed at http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/ on September 20, 2023

### Technologies Used
* Javascript
* D3 library
* Plotly
  * Bar chart
  * Bubble Chart
  * Gauge
* HTML
